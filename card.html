          This breed likes to be active. Remember, golden retrievers are bird
          dogs at heart, so they love a good game of fetch or a swim. If
          exercise is provided daily, golden retrievers can adapt to any type of
          home, even if it is a city apartment. Golden retrievers are considered
          average shedders. Brushing about once weekly will keep the coat
          looking nice.
